# Linear Search

Linear Search is a method for finding a target value within a list.

### Performance:

- Worst Case run time of O(n). Average case of O(n/2)

### Basic Algorithm

```
Given a list L of n elements with values or records L0 .... Lnâˆ’1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses linear search to find the index of the target T in L.[3]

Set i to 0.
If Li = T, the search terminates successfully; return i.
Increase i by 1.
If i < n, go to step 2. Otherwise, the search terminates unsuccessfully.
```
