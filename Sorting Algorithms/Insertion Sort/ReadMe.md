# Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort, works by splitting the array into two sections — a sorted and an unsorted one.

#### Performance:

- Insertion sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2)
- Space Complexity : O(1). In-place.
- Efficient for data sets that are sorted or nearly sorted in which case time complexity drops to O(n).
