# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort. This algorithm compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.


Performance:

- Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n2)
- This algorithm is better than quick sort but not insertion sort to check if an algorithm is already sorted or not.
