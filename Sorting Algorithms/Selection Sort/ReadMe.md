# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort.

We select the first element as the minimum and then procced to traverse the array and if we find an element that is smaller than our designated minimum, we designate this new number as the minimum and then repeat the procedure.


Performance:

- Selection sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n2)
- selection sort almost always outperforms bubble sort and gnome sort.
- In Place sorting. Space Complexity O(1)
